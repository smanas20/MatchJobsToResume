# JobMatcher: AI-Powered Job Search Automation

This project automates job searching by:
- Scraping job boards (currently RemoteOK, with Adzuna and Wellfound support planned)
- Matching job listings against your resume using NLP
- Exporting results to both a CSV and a Google Sheet

## Features
- âœ… Resume matching using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- âœ… Live scraping from RemoteOK
- âœ… Google Sheets export via service account
- ðŸ”œ Support for Adzuna and Wellfound APIs
- ðŸ”œ Filters for location, H1B sponsorship, tags, and salary

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo & create a virtual environment**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MatchJobsToResume.git
cd jobmatcher
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Prepare your resume**
- Save your resume as plain text: `data/resume.txt`

3. **Set up Google Sheets export**
